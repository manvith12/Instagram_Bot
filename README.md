# Instagram Bot Application Development Summary

## Project Overview

### Aim
Our aim is to develop a robust Instagram bot application using PyQt5 that automates interactions such as liking posts, commenting, and sending messages, aimed at enhancing user productivity and experience on Instagram.

## Goals
- **Automation**: Simplify and automate interactions on Instagram to streamline user experience.
- **User Interface**: Design an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface using PyQt5.
- **Security**: Ensure user data security with a transparent and clear security agreement accessible within the application.

## Achievements So Far
- Developed a PyQt5-based GUI for the Instagram bot application.
- Implemented functionalities including logging in, liking posts, commenting, and sending messages.
- Integrated a clickable button to display a detailed security agreement with a smooth fade-in animation.
- Created a separate dialog (`SecurityAgreementDialog`) to present the security agreement text with a close button for enhanced clarity.

## Call for Collaboration
We are currently seeking collaborations with developers interested in PyQt5, social media automation, and user interface design. If you're passionate about improving social media interactions through innovative solutions, we'd love to collaborate with you!
